### What is Apptitude?
Apptitude is boilerplate code that allows you to quickly deploy a React.js/Redux.js app (with pseudo routes) on Github pages in minutes. It's now easier than ever to share software!

The output file of webpack (named 'bundle.js' by default) must be updated and uploaded to Github in order for it to work on Github pages.

### How to Use
1. Clone this project into your project folder.
2. Remove .git using `rm -rf .git`
3. Create a new .git using `git init`
4. Update `package.json` as needed
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm start`
7. You can view local changes by running `open index.html`
